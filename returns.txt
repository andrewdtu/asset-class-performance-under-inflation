The portfolio returns vary between the random portfolio weight, but in general, the first-period portfolio return outperforms the S&P 500 return, while the second-period portfolio performs slightly better than the S&P 500 return. Here are two major reasons for the difference: the first reason is that XLE (Energy Select Sector) had a strong performance in the first period but a negative performance in the second period. We thought the energy sector could have a strong performance during inflation, but during President Donald Trump’s term, he increased the oil production in the US. Thus, the energy price was relatively low during the second period, which leads the XLE’s performance struggles. The return of XLK (Technology Select Sector) in period 2 is much better than the return in period 1. The major reason could be attributed to President Trump’s economic policy, which gives more incentives to technology companies. Also, XLY (Consumer Discretionary Select Sector) performed badly in the first period, but XLP (Consumer Staples Select Sector) performed badly in the second period. The higher interest rate would lower the consumption. In the first period, people choose to reduce their consumption of Consumer Discretionary. However, in the second period, people choose to reduce their consumption of Consumer Staples. It’s the difference in the preference based on economic development. We should use the first period’s optimized portfolio for this inflation period because the energy policy now is much different from the second period. Since Biden’s administration reduced oil production, the energy price has been much higher than before. Thus, we can get a good return by investing in the energy sector.
