The portfolio returns vary between the random portfolio weight, but in general, the first-period portfolio return outperforms the S&P 500 return, while the second-period portfolio performs slightly better than the S&P 500 return. 
 We should use the first period's optimized portfolio for this inflation period because the energy policy now is much different from the second period. Since Biden's administration reduced oil production, the energy price has been much higher than before. Thus, we can get a good return by investing in the energy sector.
