About the portfolio return: The returns vary between the random portfolio weight, but in general, the first-period portfolio return is much better than the S&P 500 return. But the second-period portfolio return is just beating up the S&P 500 return.
Here are two major reasons for the difference. The first reason is that XLE (Energy Select Sector) had a strong performance in the first period but the bad performance in the second period. We usually think the energy sector can have good performance during the inflation, but during President Donald Trump's term, he increases the oil production in the US. Thus, the energy price was relatively low during the second period, which leads the XLE performance bad. Since we have a negative return sector in the second period, our portfolio cannot perform well as the first one.

Here is another interesting finding, the return of XLK (Technology Select Sector) in period 2 is much better than the return in period 1. The major reason should be President Donald Trump's economic policy, which gives more incentives to the technology companies. We tend to invest similarly to the first period for this inflation period because the energy policy is much different from the second period. After reducing oil production, the energy price has been much higher than before. We can get a good return by investing in the energy sector.
