The portfolio returns vary between the random portfolio weight, but in general, the first-period portfolio return is outperforming the S&P 500 return while the second-period portfolio return is similar to the S&P 500 return. Here are two major reasons for the difference: the first reason is that XLE (Energy Select Sector) had a strong performance in the first period but negative performance in the second period. 
We thought the energy sector can have a strong performance during inflation, but during President Donald Trump's term, he increases the oil production in the US. Thus, the energy price was relatively low during the second period, which leads the XLE's performance struggles. Since we have a negative return sector in the second period, our portfolio cannot perform as well as the first period. 
The return of XLK (Technology Select Sector) in period 2 is much better than the return in period 1. The major reason could be attributed to President Trump's economic policy, which gives more incentives to technology companies. We should use first period's optimized portfolio for this inflation period because the energy policy is much different from the second period. After Biden's administration reduced oil production, the energy price has been much higher than before. Thus, we can get a good return by investing in the energy sector.
